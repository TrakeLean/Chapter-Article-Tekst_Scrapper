# Chapter-Article-Tekst_Scrapper
Give you the text scrapped and stored within a dictionary
something like this (i think)
{[chapter: [article: paragraph, paragraph, paragraph]]}

so
{[1: [1: [hello today we're selling ice cream for 10kr, the first think we need to do is setup a shop, lastly we steal the ice cream back form the buyers]
      2: [minh turns into viego at 3am, do not approach minh when it's 3 am]],
  2: [1: [Hello i am a new chapter],
      2: [The last article only contained one paragrahp? that's weird, i'm glad i containe 2]}
